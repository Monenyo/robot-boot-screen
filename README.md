# Robot Eyes – System Boot Demo

This repository hosts a single‐page HTML demo that simulates a cinematic “system boot” sequence for a robot AI interface. It features:

- A scrolling console log with GPT-4o initialization steps to be convincing
- There is also some information about the iPhone 14 Pro Max but that is some random thing I added because it was a personal project at first. So feel free to change.
- A boot screen (“4o” logo + spinning dots)
- A “Welcome back” message  
- Eyes that open with a smooth animation, blink, and sparkle  
- Real‐time microphone‐powered VU bars when you tap/click (green “talking” mode)  
- Pointer‐tracking highlights inside the eyes  
- Device‐motion parallax that shifts the eyes based on your phone’s orientation  
- A double‐tap “surprise” wide‐eye effect  
- A status bar at the bottom (battery, network, time)
